# NBA-Data-Analysis
Project to explore data from the NBA API. In this project, we take the user input for two teams and the stat that they want to visualize. After that, we take the last 20 games of those teams in the 2021 season, displaying in a chart the progression of that team in that stat's context, showing the made/conceded lines throughout those games.

## Example
Given that the teams chosen were the Philadelphia 76ers and the Los Angeles Lakers, we get the following charts for the Points stat:
