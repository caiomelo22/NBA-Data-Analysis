# NBA-Data-Analysis
Project to explore data from the NBA API. In this project, we take the user input for two teams and the stat that they want to visualize. After that, we take the last 20 games of those teams in the 2021 season, displaying in a chart the progression of that team in that stat's context, showing the made/conceded lines throughout those games.

The last part of the project is about the distribution around a line set by the user. After setting the line, the program prints on the screen the percentage of games that each teams had their totals above the given line, displaying the progression of those 20 games in a chart with a red line that represents the given value.

## Example
For the Philadelphia 76ers and the Los Angeles Lakers as the chosen teams, PTS as the chosen stat and 217.5 as the chosen line, we get the following outputs:
